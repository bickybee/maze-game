# maze-game
A winter-themed maze game made with OpenGL, GLUT, and C++. 

Choose between two characters, a snowman and a penguin. Navigate the maze, find all nine baubles, beat your best time! Every game is different, because the level is randomly generated each play.

(the screencap software being used has a low framerate, the animations are smoother in the real game!)
